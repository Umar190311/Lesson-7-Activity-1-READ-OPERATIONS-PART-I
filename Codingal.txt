What are the benefits of learning coding for my child?

Learning to code helps kids improve their logical thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, creativity, mathematics, and writing skills. When a kid learns to code, it also gives them valuable skills in life and at the workplace.

Coding provides a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships, and jobs.
